// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

/* Answer
SDLC is a conceptual framework describing all activities in a software development project from planning to maintenance.
Step 1. Planning
Step 2. Analysis of Requirements
Step 3. Design
Step 4. Implementation
Step 5. Testing & Integration
Step 6. Maintain
*/


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
